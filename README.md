# Hello-world
This is where my programming journey starts

Hi guys, If you're reading this that "meins" it's March 30th 2019, 8:54 pm
I just joined HNG internship 5 and have been told to do this excercise 

ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜‹, it's just like nothing more though I've not met her 
Anyway I love C# programming language and also have a strong interest in learning C++
This is 2019, "we go buy Benz" after we don learn programming finish el O el.
